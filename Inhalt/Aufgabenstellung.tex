We are here trying to calculate optical absorbtion spectra with vasp. The atomic configuration is a cavity inside a neon crystal that was proposed to be filled with either a single sodium atom or two sodiumm atoms (a sodium dimer). Now the first step was to find configurations of cavities, i.e. how many neon atoms will be replaced by an inserted sodium atom and subsequntly by a sodium dimer. This substitution number will be denoted as $S$ in the following thesis. For these specific configurations the optical absorbtion spectra will be calculated and compared with the experiment.
